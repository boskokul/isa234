## Description
Web application built using Spring Boot and Angular as a student project for Internet software architectures course.

This application is a system for managing the ordering and delivery of medical equipment to hospitals. To address potential conflicts during database entries, we implemented pessimistic locks where necessary. Additionally, we proposed a proof of concept for scaling the application to accommodate a larger number of users. RabbitMQ was used to communicate with another application that simulated a hospital creating a contract for regular equipment delivery, while Kafka was used to simulate the delivery process by transmitting coordinates.
